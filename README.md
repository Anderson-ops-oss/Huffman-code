# Huffman Code Project

This project implements the Huffman coding algorithm for encoding and decoding. It provides practical applications in areas such as cybersecurity and algorithm design.

There are three Python files in this project:
  1. huffmanCode.py – A simple implementation with detailed explanations, intended for learning and understanding the algorithm.
  2. huffmanCodeEncode.py – A script for encoding messages.
  3. huffmanCodeDecode.py – A script for decoding messages.
You can modify the contents of input.txt to test different encoded messages.

How to Run:
  1. For huffmanCode.py and huffmanCodeEncode.py: python huffmanCode.py input.txt
  2. For huffmanCodeDecode.py: python huffmanCodeDecode.py
